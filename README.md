# 🛠️ AEM Project Generator

## 📌 Overview

**AEM Project Generator** is a web-based tool inspired by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), designed to streamline the creation of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project structures. It empowers developers to easily generate a fully configured AEM Maven project by filling out a form and selecting predefined components and templates.

The application is built using **Spring Boot** and provides a guided multi-step form UI to input project metadata, select components/templates, and generate a ready-to-use zipped AEM project scaffold.

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this tool is to **eliminate the manual and repetitive effort** involved in setting up the initial AEM project structure. It allows developers and solution architects to:

- Quickly prototype AEM projects
- Maintain consistency across different AEM initiatives
- Simplify onboarding for new developers
- Enable generation for both AEM 6.5.x and AEM Cloud Service compatible projects
